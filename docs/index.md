# Get Started

Simplify the usage of containers.

You may be thinking, why do I need a new library that wrap-up docker-compose or
podman-compose if they are already really simple to use?

Yes, they are simple to use, but if you have some other parameters to the
compose command line, it could be very tedious to write them every time such as
`--env-file`, `--project-name`, `--file`, etc.

So, in this case we could use something like a script or `make`, right?

Yes, and just for one project it would be good enough. But, if you maintain or
collaborate a bunch of projects, it would be like a boiler plate.

Additionally, if you are maintaining some extra scripts in order to improve your
containers stack, these scripts would be like a boilerplate as well.

So, the idea of this project is to organize your stack of containers, gathering
some useful scripts and keeping this information centralized in a configuration
file. So the command line would be very simple.

## How to Install

```bash
$ pip install containers-sugar
```

## Features

The commands from docker-compose available are:

- build
- config
- create
- down
- events
- exec
- images
- kill
- logs
- pause
- port
- ps
- pull
- push
- restart
- rm
- run
- start
- stop
- top
- unpause
- up
- version

These commands are available in the main profile/plugin, so you don't need to
specify any extra parameter to access them.

For extra commands, we are gathering them into a profile/plugin called `ext`, so
you can access them using something like: `sugar compose-ext restart`.

The current available **ext** commands are:

- start -> alias for `up`
- restart -> runs `stop` and `up`

Sugar also provides support for Docker Swarm through the `swarm` plugin, which
includes:

- Initialize and manage swarm clusters
- Deploy and manage stacks
- Manage services (scaling, updating, rollback)
- Manage swarm nodes

See the [Swarm documentation](swarm.md) for more details.

## How to use it

First you need to place the config file `.sugar.yaml` in the root of your
project. This is an example of a configuration file:

```yaml
backend: compose
defaults:
  group:  {% raw %} ${{ env.ENV }} {% endraw %}
groups:
  group1:
    project-name: project1
    config-path:
      - containers/tests/group1/compose.yaml
    env-file: .env
    services:
      default:
        - service1
        - service3
      available:
        - name: service1
        - name: service2
        - name: service3
  group2:
    project-name: null
    config-path: containers/tests/group2/compose.yaml
    env-file: .env
    services:
      # default: null
      available:
        - name: service1
        - name: service2
```

Some examples of how to use it:

- build the defaults services (service1,service3) for group1:
  `sugar build --group group1`

- build the all services (there is no default service defined) for group2:
  `sugar build --group group2`

- build all services (ignore default) for group1:
  `sugar build --group group1 --all`

- start the default services for group1: `sugar compose-ext start --group group`

- restart all services (ignore defaults) for group1:
  `sugar compose-ext restart --group group1 --all`

- restart service1 and service2 for group1:
  `sugar compose-ext restart --group group1 --services service1,service2`

**NOTE**: If you use: `default: group: {% raw %} ${{ env.ENV }} {% endraw %}`,
you don't need to give `--group <GROUP_NAME>`, except if you want a different
group than the default one.
